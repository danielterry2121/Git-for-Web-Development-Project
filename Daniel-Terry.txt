	Classes can be used on any number of elements , while ID's are restricted to one use, for one element.
	Classes are also less specific than ID's and therefore can be easily over-ridden . I'd use classes for most general
	changes , that way when fine tuning I could always use an ID.
	An Example:
	I turn this whole section of code a different color when I hover over it, but I also want to make the Header of the section
	capitalize when I hover over it , but not all of the paragraphs. I could simply give it it's own ID with that style.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

	Inline takes up no additional space , and almost like carries no mass. While block elements are displayed as Chunks of content.
	inline-block is a great way to display items in a list side by side, and still give them there own sort of box.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

	It's position is fixed , often good to use an absolutely positioned element for other elements to relative off of. Keeping a page balanced your way.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

	box-sizing:border-box; -Makes all of the content take up a certain amount of space, I'd probably use a wrapping element with this method to control 
	multiple elements on my page while still in control of the width.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

	



	block:<p>,<div>,<h1 to (etc)>,<ol>, <ul>

	inline-block: <button>
	

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?

	We can limit this by using the box-sizing:border-box; method.
